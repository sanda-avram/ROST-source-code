# ROST-source-code
## Context:

The source code was written for the tests described in the paper called "[A comparison of several AI techniques for authorship attribution on Romanian texts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365299177_A_comparison_of_several_AI_techniques_for_authorship_attribution_on_Romanian_texts)". Here, several AI techniques were compared for classifying literary texts written by multiple authors by taking into account a limited number of speech parts (prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions). The dataset contains 400 Romanian texts written by 10 authors and it can be foud at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandamariaavram/rost-romanian-stories-and-other-texts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandamariaavram/rost-romanian-stories-and-other-texts). The compared methods are Artificial Neural Networks, Multi Expression Programming, k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees with C5.0.
